	<description>Restricted Storage allows you to restrict who can take things FROM storage.
   
THIS MOD IS A WORK IN PROGRESS, but I thought I would share.

In the vanilla game, "storage" means Shelves.
I use this with Deep Storage (my favorite storage mod, it's really awesome) but it should work with any storage buildings out there!
