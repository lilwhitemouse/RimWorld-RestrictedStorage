	<description>Restricted Storage allows you to restrict who can take things FROM storage.
 
This mod is a Work In Progress, but it is FULLY FUNCTIONAL and I thought I would share.

I would love Assistance from an Artist with the various "not allowed" overlays!

In the vanilla game, "storage" means Shelves.
I use this with Deep Storage (my favorite storage mod, it's really awesome) but it should work with any storage buildings out there!
