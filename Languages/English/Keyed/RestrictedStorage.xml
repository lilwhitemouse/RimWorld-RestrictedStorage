  <LWM.RS.AnimalsThatEatNoMeat>There's this really fun song by Solstice Assembly called Vegan Fight Song. You can find a version online if you look!

Anyway,\nthis is specifically animals that CANNOT eat meat - so if an animal can both graze and chomp on corpses, it won't qualify here</LWM.RS.AnimalsThatEatNoMeat>
